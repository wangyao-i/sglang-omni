# Qwen3-ASR 1.7B on Ascend 910B: hardware handoff

This page is the source of truth for the local-development and isolated-Ascend
qualification effort. It is written for the local SGLang-Omni developer and
the operator of the isolated 910B server. Update this page when a gate changes;
the companion task pages contain executable procedures, not competing status
or support claims.

## Scope and status

Target topology: one Ascend 910B, one Qwen3-ASR-1.7B stage, BF16, no model
quantization, and no tensor or data parallelism.

Status at base commit `e7d876b28326c55d777ae62e1c3650b816785d8c`:

| Area | Repository state | 910B evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ascend installation | NPU manifest, precheck, and installation guide are implemented | NPU precheck must be rerun on the target server |
| Qwen3-ASR model path | Single-stage model, batching, pre-LM encoder, SSE output, and long-audio upload chunking are implemented | Not yet started on 910B |
| Generation graph | Enabled by the Qwen3-ASR defaults and delegated to SGLang | Compatibility and correctness not yet verified on 910B |
| Encoder graph | Implemented with `torch.cuda.Stream`, `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`, and `torch.cuda.graph`; enabled by default | Incompatible by inspection; the first baseline run must preserve the complete failure evidence |
| Pre-LM encoder service | NPU tensors use the default device stream; the dedicated stream path is CUDA-only | Functionality, synchronization, and throughput not yet verified on 910B |
| SSE transcription | Emits decoder-token deltas after the complete upload has entered one engine request | Not continuous audio-input realtime |
| Realtime WebSocket | Buffers PCM16 until VAD stops, then runs a response pass followed by a transcription pass | Does not meet the incremental-ASR target by inspection; not yet verified on 910B |

The repository therefore supports installing SGLang-Omni on Ascend, but does
not yet claim that Qwen3-ASR is supported or qualified on 910B. A check mark is
added only after redacted evidence from the isolated server passes the relevant
gate.

## Acceptance contract

The performance values below are targets, not measured results. Correctness and
stability gates are prerequisites; an optimization that changes recognized text
outside the declared accuracy allowance or silently falls back is a failure.

### Offline transcription gate

- Input set: a frozen manifest of 16 kHz, mono, PCM16 speech clips, each
  `10.000 s` with a maximum duration error of one audio sample. The manifest,
  language mix, transcript references, and file hashes stay on the isolated
  server; the returned evidence contains only an aggregate manifest hash and
  aggregate metrics.
- Workload: closed-loop concurrency `70`, one uploaded clip per request, no
  repeated-audio cache hits, explicit language hints matching the manifest,
  and non-streaming JSON responses.
- Warm-up and sample size: discard at least one complete concurrency wave, then
  measure at least `700` requests per repeat and run three repeats in fresh
  server processes.
- Latency interval: client timestamp immediately after the complete multipart
  body is written through receipt of the final response body. Report mean,
  p50, p90, p95, p99, and maximum. The hard target is p95 below `500 ms` in
  every repeat.
- Capacity: all measured requests return success; request shedding, timeouts,
  empty responses, and retries count as failures. At the latency target,
  concurrency 70 implies approximately `140 requests/s` and, for exact 10 s
  clips, `1400 input-audio-seconds/s`; report measured throughput and RTFx
  rather than treating those derived values as separate proof.
- Accuracy: first freeze the eager-NPU baseline on the same manifest. Later
  variants must produce the same normalized transcript for the smoke set and
  must not regress corpus WER/CER from that baseline. Public SeedTTS checks use
  the repository's existing ASR thresholds rather than duplicating them here.

### Realtime transcription gate

“Realtime” means audio is accepted continuously and partial recognition is
produced before end-of-utterance. SSE deltas from a fully uploaded file and a
VAD-triggered whole-utterance request do not satisfy this definition.

- Transport: 70 simultaneous WebSocket sessions; PCM16 mono at 16 kHz; one
  `500 ms` chunk appended every `500 ms` for a 10 s utterance.
- Partial latency: for every eligible chunk after speech start, measure from
  completion of that chunk's append event to the first transcript event that
  incorporates it. The target is p95 below `500 ms` across sessions.
- Final latency: measure from the final audio commit/end-of-speech event to the
  completed transcript event. The target is p95 below `500 ms`.
- Stability: all 70 sessions complete without disconnect, request shedding,
  cross-session transcript leakage, unbounded buffer growth, or device OOM.
- Semantics: partial text may revise only through an explicit protocol event;
  the final normalized text must match the offline result for the same audio.

The first realtime milestone is transcription only. Conversational response,
TTS output, word timestamps, forced alignment, multi-card execution, and model
weight changes are outside this qualification.

## Ownership boundary

- This repository owns Qwen3-ASR configuration, model adaptation, batching,
  audio ingress, benchmark tooling, tests, operator documentation, and any
  platform-neutral graph/stream dispatch added here.
- SGLang owns NPU scheduler, attention backend, generation graph, allocator,
  and device runtime behavior. A defect reproduced below the Omni adapter needs
  a minimal upstream reproducer and an exact SGLang revision.
- `torch_npu`, CANN, `triton-ascend`, and `sgl-kernel-npu` own device operators
  and compiler/runtime behavior. The server operator records exact versions
  chosen from the official compatibility matrices; this repository does not
  invent a second version matrix.

Do not patch `site-packages`, copy private model artifacts into the repository,
or convert a failed graph path into an unreported eager fallback. A fallback is
acceptable only when it is explicit in configuration and independently
qualified.

## Qualification sequence

1. Run the [first hardware validation task](qwen3_asr_ascend_910b_validation_task.md)
   on the unchanged base commit and classify the earliest complete failure.
2. Reproduce or isolate the failure locally where possible, make one bounded
   repository change, add focused tests, and map its local commit to the exact
   server commit.
3. Repeat minimal import, startup, batch 1, two-request, sequential, bounded
   concurrency, health, and memory gates in new processes.
4. Only after eager correctness is stable, run the
   [performance and realtime task](qwen3_asr_ascend_910b_performance_task.md).
5. Compare one variable at a time against the frozen eager-NPU baseline. Retain
   only changes that pass correctness, stability, and repeated performance
   gates.

## Evidence record

For each remote run, add a row here after reviewing its redacted result:

| Run | Server commit | Local equivalent | Stack fingerprint | Gate | Result | First failure or key metric |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 910B-000 | pending | `e7d876b2` | pending | baseline startup | pending | pending |

The returned evidence may contain commit IDs, package versions, command lines,
test names, tensor shapes/dtypes, aggregate latency/throughput/accuracy, peak
memory, and sanitized traceback categories. It must not contain model paths,
hostnames, usernames, IP addresses, tokens, raw audio, transcripts, full logs,
or proprietary profiler captures.
