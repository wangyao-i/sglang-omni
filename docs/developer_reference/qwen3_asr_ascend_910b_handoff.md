# Qwen3-ASR 1.7B on Ascend 910B: hardware handoff

This page is the source of truth for the local-development and isolated-Ascend
qualification effort. It is written for the local SGLang-Omni developer and
the operator of the isolated 910B server. Update this page when a gate changes;
the companion task pages contain executable procedures, not competing status
or support claims.

**Server-task synchronization rule:** every new request for isolated-server
execution must be written into this handoff before the operator runs it. A
server experiment mentioned only in chat is not an executable task. Each
completed run must replace or close the previous task here before another
server-side variable is introduced.

## Scope and status

Target topology: one Ascend 910B, one Qwen3-ASR-1.7B stage, BF16, no model
quantization, and no tensor or data parallelism.

Status at base commit `e7d876b28326c55d777ae62e1c3650b816785d8c`:
**A3 eager functional baseline passed; decode graph qualification has separate
small-batch torch-compile and large-batch ATB blockers**.

The first remote run used `Ascend910_9382`, which the current Ascend ecosystem
identifies as A3 hardware. It is therefore recorded as the derived run
`910C-000`, not as proof for the original 910B target. The 910B qualification
remains unstarted until the same gates run on the intended device class.

| Area | Repository state | 910B evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ascend installation | NPU manifest, precheck, and installation guide are implemented | Precheck passed on A3; not yet run on the target 910B |
| Qwen3-ASR model path | Single-stage model, batching, pre-LM encoder, SSE output, and long-audio upload chunking are implemented | A3 eager batch 1, two-concurrent, ten-sequential, health, shutdown, and restart gates passed after repairing the OpenCV environment; not yet started on 910B |
| Generation graph | Enabled by the Qwen3-ASR defaults and delegated to SGLang | A3 prefill capture succeeded; decode capture failed at Dynamo/triton-ascend for compiled batch 1 and independently at ATB `PagedAttentionOperation` for non-compiled batch 64; not yet verified on 910B |
| Encoder graph | Implemented with `torch.cuda.Stream`, `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`, and `torch.cuda.graph`; enabled by default | Incompatible by inspection; the first baseline run must preserve the complete failure evidence |
| Pre-LM encoder service | NPU tensors use the default device stream; the dedicated stream path is CUDA-only | A3 eager functionality and restart stability passed; graph mode remains blocked before serving |
| SSE transcription | Emits decoder-token deltas after the complete upload has entered one engine request | Not continuous audio-input realtime |
| Realtime WebSocket | Buffers PCM16 until VAD stops, then runs a response pass followed by a transcription pass | Does not meet the incremental-ASR target by inspection; not yet verified on 910B |

The repository therefore supports installing SGLang-Omni on Ascend, but does
not yet claim that Qwen3-ASR is supported or qualified on 910B. A check mark is
added only after redacted evidence from the isolated server passes the relevant
gate.

## Acceptance contract

The performance values below are targets, not measured results. Correctness and
stability gates are prerequisites; an optimization that changes recognized text
outside the declared accuracy allowance or silently falls back is a failure.

### Offline transcription gate

- Input set: a frozen manifest of 16 kHz, mono, PCM16 speech clips, each
  `10.000 s` with a maximum duration error of one audio sample. The manifest,
  language mix, transcript references, and file hashes stay on the isolated
  server; the returned evidence contains only an aggregate manifest hash and
  aggregate metrics.
- Workload: closed-loop concurrency `70`, one uploaded clip per request, no
  repeated-audio cache hits, explicit language hints matching the manifest,
  and non-streaming JSON responses.
- Warm-up and sample size: discard at least one complete concurrency wave, then
  measure at least `700` requests per repeat and run three repeats in fresh
  server processes.
- Latency interval: client timestamp immediately after the complete multipart
  body is written through receipt of the final response body. Report mean,
  p50, p90, p95, p99, and maximum. The hard target is p95 below `500 ms` in
  every repeat.
- Capacity: all measured requests return success; request shedding, timeouts,
  empty responses, and retries count as failures. At the latency target,
  concurrency 70 implies approximately `140 requests/s` and, for exact 10 s
  clips, `1400 input-audio-seconds/s`; report measured throughput and RTFx
  rather than treating those derived values as separate proof.
- Accuracy: first freeze the eager-NPU baseline on the same manifest. Later
  variants must produce the same normalized transcript for the smoke set and
  must not regress corpus WER/CER from that baseline. Public SeedTTS checks use
  the repository's existing ASR thresholds rather than duplicating them here.

### Realtime transcription gate

“Realtime” means audio is accepted continuously and partial recognition is
produced before end-of-utterance. SSE deltas from a fully uploaded file and a
VAD-triggered whole-utterance request do not satisfy this definition.

- Transport: 70 simultaneous WebSocket sessions; PCM16 mono at 16 kHz; one
  `500 ms` chunk appended every `500 ms` for a 10 s utterance.
- Partial latency: for every eligible chunk after speech start, measure from
  completion of that chunk's append event to the first transcript event that
  incorporates it. The target is p95 below `500 ms` across sessions.
- Final latency: measure from the final audio commit/end-of-speech event to the
  completed transcript event. The target is p95 below `500 ms`.
- Stability: all 70 sessions complete without disconnect, request shedding,
  cross-session transcript leakage, unbounded buffer growth, or device OOM.
- Semantics: partial text may revise only through an explicit protocol event;
  the final normalized text must match the offline result for the same audio.

The first realtime milestone is transcription only. Conversational response,
TTS output, word timestamps, forced alignment, multi-card execution, and model
weight changes are outside this qualification.

## Ownership boundary

- This repository owns Qwen3-ASR configuration, model adaptation, batching,
  audio ingress, benchmark tooling, tests, operator documentation, and any
  platform-neutral graph/stream dispatch added here.
- SGLang owns NPU scheduler, attention backend, generation graph, allocator,
  and device runtime behavior. A defect reproduced below the Omni adapter needs
  a minimal upstream reproducer and an exact SGLang revision.
- `torch_npu`, CANN, `triton-ascend`, and `sgl-kernel-npu` own device operators
  and compiler/runtime behavior. The server operator records exact versions
  chosen from the official compatibility matrices; this repository does not
  invent a second version matrix.

Do not patch `site-packages`, copy private model artifacts into the repository,
or convert a failed graph path into an unreported eager fallback. A fallback is
acceptable only when it is explicit in configuration and independently
qualified.

## Derived A3 qualification record

The isolated operator executed steps 1 through 4 of the first validation task.
The full logs remain in the server-local `qwen3-asr-910c-000` evidence
directory; this section contains only the reviewable, redacted result.

### Frozen environment and completed gates

- SGLang-Omni was detached at clean commit `e7d876b2`; the NPU precheck passed.
- Hardware was `Ascend910_9382`, 16 devices with 64 GiB HBM per device. The
  qualification topology used one device.
- Runtime fingerprint: CANN toolkit 9.0.1, PyTorch 2.10.0+cpu,
  `torch_npu` 2.10.0.post2, SGLang package 0.5.18,
  `triton-ascend` 3.2.1, and SGLang-Omni 0.1.3 at `e7d876b2`. The initial runs
  did not return the exact SGLang Git HEAD. Run `910C-004` later recorded
  `71de97b264b04dcd514cf904003028aefe9775c8`; that commit is required unchanged
  for subsequent comparison but is not retroactive proof of the initial state.
- The NPU installer suite passed 22 tests. The focused Qwen3-ASR suite passed
  588 tests with 3 skipped. An earlier collection failure came from an old
  editable SGLang 0.5.16 fork and disappeared after the operator installed the
  intended 0.5.18 package; it is an environment correction, not model evidence.
- Default startup failed after prefill graph capture succeeded and decode graph
  capture failed while setting up `PagedAttentionOperation`.
- The explicit eager diagnostic profile became ready. Its first smoke request
  returned HTTP 500, so the operator correctly stopped before the two-request,
  ten-sequential, restart, concurrency, and performance gates.
- All service processes were stopped, ports were released, and device memory
  returned to the approximately 3 GiB idle baseline.

### First complete eager failure

With synchronous NPU launch enabled, the first request reached the audio tower
and failed at its first-layer `conv2d`. `torch_npu` reported
`AclSetCompileopt(ACL_PRECISION_MODE)` error 500001. The nested CANN error is
the actionable failure: `GEInitializeV2` could not initialize because
`multiprocessing.Manager` instantiation failed, after which TBE custom-store,
fusion-manager, and ops-manager initialization also failed.

The failure was stable across three requests. Host memory, file descriptors,
shared memory, inodes, and device HBM were all sufficient. Five progressively
closer standalone probes passed, including BF16 `conv2d`, non-JIT compile mode,
a thread-pool worker, and a spawn child process whose worker thread executed
the operator. Those probes rule out a general A3 `conv2d` failure.

### Resolved eager root cause and ownership

The daemon-process diagnosis recorded in commit `fa27495d` is rejected by run
`910C-001`. The operator first confirmed the Python invariant independently:
`multiprocessing.Manager()` raises `AssertionError: daemonic processes are not
allowed to have children` in a daemon spawn child and succeeds in an otherwise
equivalent non-daemon child. The service-side A/B then changed only the ASR
stage process to `daemon=False`; an explicit diagnostic line confirmed the
failing stage PID was non-daemon. Batch 1 nevertheless failed in that same PID
with the unchanged CANN Manager EC0009, `GEInitializeV2`, and error-500001
chain. The checkout was restored to `daemon=True` and a clean worktree after
the diagnostic run.

Run `910C-002` resolved the previously unknown boundary. The CANN wrapper hid
an `EOFError` in the Manager parent. Its `SyncManager` server child exited while
the spawn bootstrap re-imported the `sgl-omni` main module: the import chain
reached `cv2.typing`, then `cv2.mat_wrapper`, which failed because
`libGL.so.1` was absent. The child closed its bootstrap pipe without returning
the Manager address, the parent raised `EOFError`, and CANN converted it to
EC0009 before the outer GE and `AclSetCompileopt` failures.

This was an environment dependency collision, not a CANN, `torch_npu`,
SGLang, SGLang-Omni, daemon-process, or `conv2d` defect. Both OpenCV wheel
variants had been installed into the same `cv2` namespace, and the later
non-headless installation won. The operator removed `opencv-python` and
force-reinstalled `opencv-python-headless` 5.0.0 without dependencies. This is
the exact validated A3 repair, not a repository-wide version pin. Afterward
`cv2` imported successfully and its binary had no unresolved `libGL`
dependency; the CANN Manager/GE failure signature disappeared.

The operator also found and force-stopped a stage process orphaned from the
initial validation for more than 12 hours, with PPID 1 and approximately 55 GiB
of chip-0 HBM. It contaminated earlier retry observations but was not the batch-1
cause: after removal, HBM returned to the approximately 3 GiB idle baseline and
a fresh non-daemon run reproduced the same failure. The orphan is retained as
a separate shutdown/reap defect relevant to the later stability gate.

### A3 eager qualification after environment repair

- The NPU installer suite passed 22 tests and the focused Qwen3-ASR suite passed
  588 tests with 3 skipped after the repair, matching the pre-repair counts.
- Eager batch 1 returned HTTP 200. Its approximately 30.2-second latency
  included first compilation and is not a performance measurement.
- Two concurrent requests both returned HTTP 200 in approximately 0.64 seconds
  wall time, with different output hashes for different inputs and no observed
  cross-request contamination.
- Ten sequential requests all returned HTTP 200 in approximately 0.35--0.40
  seconds each, with one stable output hash. These clips were functional smoke
  inputs, not the frozen exact-10-second performance corpus.
- Peak chip-0 HBM was 55,756 MiB of 65,536 MiB and remained stable. Health,
  graceful shutdown, process cleanup, port release, and a fresh-process restart
  all passed. The restart request reproduced the batch-1 output hash.
- The only scanned `ERROR` was an unrelated optional NIXL import failure; there
  was no traceback, OOM, NaN, device reset, or fallback marker.

The eager result qualifies only this A3 environment and functional workload.
It does not qualify the original 910B target, concurrency 70, exact-10-second
latency, realtime ingress, or generation graph mode.

### Independent decode graph failure

Run `910C-003` repeated default startup after the OpenCV repair. Prefill graph
capture succeeded, but decode graph capture failed on its first, largest bucket
at batch size 64 with approximately 9.28 GiB available. The complete log had
zero occurrences of EC0009, Manager instantiation, `GEInitializeV2`,
`EOFError`, `AclSetCompileopt`, error 500001, `libGL`, or `cv2`. The first
failure is instead ATB `PagedAttentionOperation setup failed` from
`OpParamMaker.cpp` and `AtbCommon.cpp` during SGLang's decode NPU graph
capture.

This is a separate graph qualification item. SGLang owns the NPU graph runner,
attention backend, capture buckets, and the call into the ATB operation;
ATB/op-plugin owns the native operation setup result. Ownership between those
components remains unresolved until the native diagnostic identifies whether
the rejected input is a batch shape, memory/workspace budget, graph-capture
constraint, or invalid operation parameter.

### Capacity-one torch-compile failure

Run `910C-004` followed the stop rule and ended at capacity 1; capacities 16,
32, and 64 were not run. The resolved profile was `cuda_graph=True`, decode
capture buckets `[1]`, `enable_torch_compile=True`,
`max_running_requests=1`, and `mem_fraction_static=0.837`. Prefill capture
succeeded in 7.80 seconds. Decode capture then failed at zero progress in
TorchDynamo before reaching ATB attention setup:

```text
torch._dynamo.exc.Unsupported: Attempted to call function marked as skipped
triton/backends/ascend/driver.py: NPUUtils.get_device_properties
```

The batch-1 log contains no `PagedAttentionOperation`, `OpParamMaker`, or
`AtbCommon` signature. Conversely, the earlier first failure at batch 64 did
not contain the Dynamo skipped-function signature. These are distinct first
failures, not evidence of a capacity threshold.

The shared configuration flag does not establish a shared torch-compile
execution path. At the exact SGLang commit used by the server,
`get_batch_sizes_to_capture()` places only capture buckets less than or equal
to `torch_compile_max_bs` in `compile_bs`. Qwen3-ASR currently defaults that
threshold to 2. Therefore the batch-1 arm is a compiled bucket, while the
first, largest batch-64 bucket from `910C-003` is non-compiled under the
reported unchanged defaults. The batch-64 ATB failure must remain an
independent graph-capture blocker.

The immediate unsupported call is implemented by `triton-ascend`, but final
fix ownership is not established by the stack alone. SGLang owns the compiled
forward boundary and should avoid tracing device discovery if the value can be
resolved and cached before compilation. A minimal reproducer against the exact
SGLang and triton-ascend revisions must determine whether that integration
change is sufficient or whether the driver must make the query safely usable
by compiler consumers. Do not apply Dynamo trace-forcing decorators as a
diagnostic workaround: they can bypass safety checks or introduce graph breaks
without proving capture/replay correctness.

### Installation hardening follow-up

The repository should add a non-mutating NPU precheck and operator guidance for
this failure class. The check should import `cv2` in a fresh spawn child, report
the installed `opencv-python` and `opencv-python-headless` distributions, and
reject the ambiguous state where both own the same `cv2` namespace. A missing
`libGL` import should explain the two operator-owned remedies: provide the
system library or use one compatible headless OpenCV distribution. The project
installer must not automatically uninstall, replace, or pin an externally
owned OpenCV stack. This is a local implementation task and is not part of the
next server run.

## Next bounded diagnostic task

Run identifier: `910C-005`. The only variable relative to the failed
capacity-1 arm of `910C-004` is **torch compile disabled**. This gate separates
decode graph capture from the small-batch Dynamo/triton-ascend failure; it does
not attempt to qualify compile performance or the batch-64 ATB path.

1. Start from a fresh process with the repaired OpenCV environment and the
   exact hardware, model, SGLang/SGLang-Omni commits, package versions, memory
   fraction, capacity 1, and graph settings from `910C-004`. Keep
   `--asr.engine.max_running_requests 1` and
   `--asr.engine.cuda_graph_max_bs 1`; change only
   `--asr.engine.enable_torch_compile false`.
2. Before startup, confirm no stale process or port owner, device HBM is at the
   idle baseline, and the tracked worktree is clean. Record the resolved
   profile and require `cuda_graph=True`, decode buckets `[1]`, and
   `torch_compile=False`; a different profile invalidates the arm.
3. Record prefill capture and decode capture separately, including first bucket,
   completed bucket count, available HBM, duration, and the first complete
   failure. Scan for both known signatures: Dynamo
   `NPUUtils.get_device_properties` and ATB `PagedAttentionOperation`.
4. If decode capture fails, preserve the first complete traceback and stop. If
   it reaches ATB setup, rerun the same arm once with
   `ATB_LOG_TO_STDOUT=1`, `ATB_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`,
   `ASDOPS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=1`, and `ASDOPS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, plus a writable CANN
   process-log directory, then stop. Do not change task-queue or synchronous
   launch policy, patch installed packages, or force Dynamo tracing.
5. If capture succeeds, send exactly one smoke request. Return an explicit
   decode graph replay/runtime marker, HTTP status, output-validity result,
   latency as diagnostic data, fallback count, and forbidden-error counts.
   Success without proof of graph replay is inconclusive. Then stop; do not run
   capacities 16, 32, or 64 in this task.
6. Stop normally and verify all service processes and ports are released,
   device health is normal, and HBM returns to baseline. A new orphan process
   is a gate failure.

Do not resume the old capacity ladder, or run concurrency, performance,
realtime, version-stack, memory-fraction, compile-threshold, or source-patch
A/Bs in `910C-005`. If this arm passes, the next task may repeat the capacity
ladder with torch compile disabled. Compile qualification remains a separate
upstream integration task; disabling it is an explicit diagnostic/configured
mode, not permission for a silent runtime fallback.

Do not run performance or realtime measurements until the functional gates are
green. A server-side diagnostic edit is not a deliverable fix; any confirmed
change must be rebuilt locally, tested, committed in this repository, and
mapped in the evidence table.

## Qualification sequence

1. Run the [first hardware validation task](qwen3_asr_ascend_910b_validation_task.md)
   on the unchanged base commit and classify the earliest complete failure.
2. Reproduce or isolate the failure locally where possible, make one bounded
   repository change, add focused tests, and map its local commit to the exact
   server commit.
3. Repeat minimal import, startup, batch 1, two-request, sequential, bounded
   concurrency, health, and memory gates in new processes.
4. After eager correctness is stable, qualify the default generation graph
   before running the
   [performance and realtime task](qwen3_asr_ascend_910b_performance_task.md).
5. Compare one variable at a time against the frozen eager-NPU baseline. Retain
   only changes that pass correctness, stability, and repeated performance
   gates.
